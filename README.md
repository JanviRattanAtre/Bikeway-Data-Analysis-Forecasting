# Bikeway Data Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bikeway data to uncover trends and patterns while leveraging forecasting techniques to predict future bikeway usage. It aims to provide actionable insights to urban planners, policymakers, and stakeholders to enhance bikeway infrastructure and optimize its usage.

## Objectives

- Perform comprehensive data analysis to explore trends, patterns, and correlations in bikeway traffic data.
- Build forecasting models to predict future bikeway usage based on historical data.
- Visualize insights and predictions through clear and interactive graphs.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, outliers, and data transformations for accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generates descriptive statistics and visualizes bikeway traffic trends.
- **Forecasting Models:** Implements time series forecasting and regression techniques to predict future bikeway usage.
- **Visualizations:** Provides meaningful visual outputs, including time-series plots, heatmaps, and trend lines.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** pandas, numpy
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **Forecasting Models:** statsmodels (ARIMA), scikit-learn, or fbprophet
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts

## Dataset

The project uses bikeway traffic data, which may include:
- Traffic volumes over time
- Temporal features like date, time, and season
- Geographical data for bikeway locations (if available)
